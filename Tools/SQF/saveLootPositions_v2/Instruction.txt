Instruction:
You can run this code in Multiplayer on a Server or in Editor.
If running in editor, make sure you have loaded the Epoch mission to have access to the current Loot Configs.
In Multiplayer on a Server, you are able to work in a group. The Variables are broadcasted, so several players can define parallel the Positions. 
1. Run the whole codes (copy/paste) within "saveLootPositions_v2_Codes.sqf" on all clients, who want to work on the LootBuilder. This code will:
	- Add MapMarkers for all Building Types without defined Loot Positions
	- Add the needed Display Eventhandlers to Place loot and save it.
2. Do your work - There are 2 procedures how you can work:
	1. 
		- Jump between random buildings with not defined Loot with F11
		- The Building you are at is automatically defined as your Loot Building.
		- Choose and place your Loot (see next chapter) or if no Loot is needed here, skip this Building with F9 (Marker will be removed)
		- Switch to the next random Building with F11...
	2.
		- Move to a Mapmarker where you want to define the Loot
		- Look on the Building and press Enter to select the Building (a hint should come up with the defined Building)
		- Choose and place your Loot (see next chapter) or if no Loot is needed here, skip this Building with F9 (Marker will be removed)
		- You can now travel to the next not defined Building and repeat the above procedure
	Choose and place Loot:
		- Choose a LootContainer for positioning with Home/End (Pos1/End)
		- Move the LootContainer to the wanted Position with the numbers on Numpad 
			- Num8 -> Move LootContainer Fwd
			- Num2 -> Move LootContainer Back
			- Num4 -> Move LootContainer left
			- Num6 -> Move LootContainer right
			- Num7 -> Rotate LootContainer counter clockwise
			- Num9 -> Rotate LootContainer Clockwise
			- PageUp -> Lift LootContainer
			- PageDown -> Lower LootContainer
		- Save this LootContainer to the Building type with Space Bar
		- The MapMarker for this Building should now get removed automatically
		- Choose the next Loot Container with Pos1/End and repeat the procedure
	Shortcuts Overwiew:
		- LootPositioning:
			- ENTER -> Select a Building
			- F9 -> Remove Marker for selected Building (without defining Loot Positions)
			- home (pos1) -> Select (switch to) next LootContainer
			- end -> Select (switch to) previous Loot Container
			- ESC -> Abort (Remove LootContainer)
			- Num8 -> Move LootContainer Fwd
			- Num2 -> Move LootContainer Back
			- Num4 -> Move LootContainer left
			- Num6 -> Move LootContainer right
			- Num7 -> Rotate LootContainer counter clockwise
			- Num9 -> Rotate LootContainer Clockwise
			- PageUp -> Lift LootContainer
			- PageDown -> Lower LootContainer
			- ctrl -> Speed up movement for LootContainer
			- Space Bar -> Save LootContainer to current BuildingType
		- Player Movement
			- F11 -> teleport to next undefined Marker
			- 4 -> Fly Up (to get faster in higher Buildings for example)
			- 5 -> Teleport 10m infront (in case you are stucked or want to move faster)
			- CTRL + Mouseclick (on Map) -> Teleport to cursor position
3. 	Export the config entries by running the code within saveLootPositions_v2_ExportConfig.sqf 
	- If in Editor, the config should be in your clipboard. 
	- If on a Server, read out the Variable "LootarrayStr" (only one CLient have to run it to get the String)
